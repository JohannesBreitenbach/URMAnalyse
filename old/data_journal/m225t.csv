1;02.12.2025;So today i had a lecture.. i didnt like waking up early as always but its lovely to share that moment with my wife (who was also tired as frigg). I was also thankful that we finally worked on the qualititative study too, even if its always hard to motivate everyone... Afterwards i got home and napped!! I love naps!!! And then my wife was home for lunch and we talked and it was very nice and fun! I also did the quiz for another lecture, so i felt a bit productive too. Then in the evening we took the train to vienna, and we went to the christkindlmarkt that Filip suggested to me. It was really nice, not a lot of peoplr there in contrast to most bigger markets, and we had great punsch and mini donuts!! A great day despite foot pains and stupid blisters on my lips. I also had a little soup snack before midnight, always a good experience :p And we worked on a lot of characters and some worldbuilding for fourth wing again, its starting to shape up good. Raya and her blood red dragon Neferati (name pending) are going to be lovely to play.;1,76E+12;1,76E+12
2;03.12.2025;So today i went shopping for groceries. it was honestly fun but i made some mistakes, i shouldve bought eggs for cookies. We'll have to do the shopping for cookies on friday instead!! Otherwise, the lecture at uni was fine but a bit boring, afterwarss i was shopping with friends. Its always nice to talk to friends and do stuff together. we finished the christmas gift box for the caritas thing we were doing, yay!! Hannah doesnt seem to be doing well, but thats almost always... i want to give her something nice to cheer up. Then I went home and had some noodles, yum. i also had a little brunch with a bit of ham, that was also pretty great. and the blisters are healing!!!! Now i hope ill have a good time with my wife before we go to sleep. hope i wont be too tired tomorrow!! Shopping and cuddling and my little brunch were the best things today!!;1,76E+12;1,76E+12
3;04.12.2025;Today was quite. boring. but also eventful. I woke up super tired for the urm lecture, but Pawel wasnt even here so it felt like i shouldve just napped instead :( I had to get myself a pity snack to keep busy, then i went to the AI lecture room. I watched an interesting creepypasta video which was fun. Then i waited with Filip for the lecture and FINALLY sent katta a mail about a masters thesis. they even responded in the evening with literally made my heart burn. Now i get to write another mail to them, which is simultaneously good and also nervewracking. AI was exhausting but at least the exercise was fine!! Filip and I had a good talk afterwards, then i went to music lessons which was a bit hectic. Unfortunately no zumba today. but i had dinner with Michi and we had a lovely time. Just a bit of cuddling to end the day! Really proud i wrote that mail finally. Good shit.;1,76E+12;1,76E+12

5;06.12.2025;We had a cookie baking day today wheeee!!!! At first we had a bit of a brunch with avocado bread. it was really nice but we didnt have enough bread unfortunately. We then went to my parents house to bake some goods together. The cookies were finicky as always, but theyre my favorites so we have to do it!! We also made chocolate truffles and started gingerbread, and made some parisian sticksies... It was really nice. My dad doesnt usually ever help with bakimg that much, at least i dont remember it. but he really did a lot this time and it was so fun. Im really thankful for that. Im also a bit sad that my grandmother felt too tired for it, but thats okay. maybe sometime we have to join her at her house to bake some things together so the recipes arent lost. Very thankful for my lovely family and my wife. Id have a boring drab life without them.;1,77E+12;1,77E+12
6;07.12.2025;I had a goooood nap today. took a good while to nap in the morning and then after lunch. I felt a bit bad about getting no work done but im taking care of it now, so i feel a lot better already. We finished making yummy cookies with my family. Im really happy my mom was feeling better this time and could help along too. My dad really seemed to have fun helping again. It was great, usually they just sit on the side while we do the fun tasks, so its nice to have them more involved too. We had an amazing lunch today with burritos and veggies. In the evening we made homemade tortillas too!! It was lovely again to talk to my wife about story, sugar may not be my favorite but its hers so i wanted to give it some time. hopefully we can talk about one of my favorites too. Im very thankful for the lovely family time.;1,77E+12;1,77E+12
7;08.12.2025;ah yes. Family. I love my sister and im so thankful that she has found someone who makes her giggle and blush like a lovestruck teenager. Its honestly so adorable. Cant wait to meet him and see what hes like. But my brother... oh my brother. we arranged this family lunch like 2 weeks ago. He cancelled. today. at like. 12. its genuinely so disrespectful to my parents i cant even believe it. so, no kids today but that was alright. i got to wear a new pullover and I LOVE IT SO MUCH. ITS AMAZING. THE SHAPE IS PERFECT. The food today was great again too of course :) it was shephards pie,one of my favorites. And some potato salad. i love my family very very.much. my wife too of course. Thankful for everyone i have around me.;1,77E+12;1,77E+12
